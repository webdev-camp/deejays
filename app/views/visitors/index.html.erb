		<H3>The song database built on giving and getting</H3>

		<P>
			Since 2007, our group members have added thousands of song suggestions to our searchable and
			sortable database. We share information about each song we suggest, including a link to an
			online sample. Our group is not for sharing music files or music downloading.

			<br/>
			<br/>
			We agree to only suggest songs that don't promote prejudice, violence, substance abuse, hatred,
			or stereotypes, and that others can readily sample online and purchase.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			When you <a href="/users/sign_up" target="/users/sign_up">sign up</a>, you are asked to give a song suggestion.
			You then get access to the song database for one month;
			each subsequent time you suggest a song you get a month of access. There are no charges and no advertisements.
		</P>
